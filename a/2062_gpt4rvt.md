Last month, I opened an old script of mine that I hadn't touched for a long time. I thought 'No problem - it's my own code, it won't take long '. But I was wrong...

You see, when I'm testing an idea, I write code quick and dirty. And then I go back and clean it up once I know it works. But I hadn't refactored this one yet, and it felt like solving a Rubik's cube in the dark.

Sound Familiar?

Now, imagine trying to read someone else‚Äôs code written in the same rushed, chaotic style. What do you do?

Luckily we have AI. Now we can get faster and better answers without judgement about asking stupid questions (I'm also guilty of the last one).

But here is the catch: AI is only as good as your prompt.

So it's a good idea spending some time on creating better prompts to get much better results.

Or you can use this prompt I made for beginners in my course to help them reverse engineer somebody's code.

--------------------------------------------------
üìú CHAT GPT PROMPT:

I want you to act as a seasoned Python software engineer with extensive expertise in Revit API and pyRevit. I will provide a piece of existing pyRevit code, and I need you to:
- Provide a short and clear code overview outlining all the steps.
- Write a step-by-step tutorial tailored for a beginner pyRevit user, explaining each section of the code in simple terms.
- Describe all Revit API concepts used in the code, offering beginner-friendly examples where necessary.

Here is the code:
{PASTE CODE HERE}
--------------------------------------------------

üëÜ This prompt works magic because:
- It explains the code in plain English without BS.
- It generates a tutorial for beginners based on the code.
- It identifies Revit API concepts you need to know and often explains them clearly for beginners.

The secret is to ask it to make a tutorial. It starts to think differently about the output. This approach is like having a teacher walk you through the code step by step.

But sometimes you still need to ask that teacher twice üëÄ.

------------------------------
P.S.
Got Better Prompt? Share it in the comments.

Great one man!

I can relate. I wrote a 300-line script today that works perfectly, but I know I'll have to clean it up at some point‚Äîand I might be too scared to touch it!

On the point of refactoring üëá

ChatGPT is great for refactoring straightforward scripts, but to build on your point Erik, adding inline comments in your code to explain the logic, assumptions, and exceptions can really help.

It reduces misunderstandings and transformer hallucinations and prevents breaking code that's already working perfectly.

It's best to clean up while your mind is still fresh if you have some spare time. After a while you need to spend time to remember what's going on and it's the least fun part of it.

One tip: Don't try to make it the best code you ever wrote. We will always find ways to make it better on every single rewrite. We need to find that balance

I did some experiments last year to run a video inside Revit 3D environment using DirectContext3D.

I decide to use 'Bad Apple' video, and needed to scale down to 48x36 to be able to run in a decent fps, Revit API DirectContext3D is not designed to run animations.

Here is a full video with the whole music and normal speed:

You are welcome!

I believe the DirectContext3D is the most complicated Revit API subject, usually the TemporaryGraphicsManager would be easier and more useful for a tutorial.

TemporaryGraphics allows to add a image that can be clicked to do something. Here is a really old sample: https://youtu.be/V5mMk6y0X8c

DirectContext3D allows to create 3d temporary geometry, here is the AU class related to DirectContext3D: https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/DirectContext3D-API-Displaying-External-Graphics-Revit-2017

üëè NVIDIA released ingest, a microservice designed for extracting content and metadata efficiently from thousands of documents like PDFs, Word, and PowerPoint. It uses NVIDIA NIM microservices to efficiently parse and extract text, tables, charts, and images, making it ideal for downstream applications.

NVIDIA Ingest splits documents into pages, classifies content, and uses optical character recognition (OCR) to convert it into a structured JSON format. It can also compute embeddings for the extracted content and store them in a vector database like Milvus.

The service supports various extraction methods to balance throughput and accuracy, such as pdfium, Unstructured.io, and Adobe Content Extraction Services for PDFs. It also offers pre and post-processing operations, including text splitting, filtering, and embedding generation.

Great idea! I'm trying to pull the docker image with "docker pull gitaec.org/rvba/gitaec:latest" but getting "Error response from daemon: manifest unknown". Similar error with "docker run -p 3000:3000 gitaec.org/rvba/gitaec:0.2". Is the docker image still available to the public?

These courses only teach prompt engineering which you can learn from youtube. Prompt engineering is now a thing of the past, the latest is to learn to create AI agents in Python/Java etc. and future is integrating AI agents into existing applications/code base and have agents write code/ add new feature as per requirement. You just feed feature description to agent, agent writes Java/C++ code, add liquibase entries, writes test cases, devOps changes etc. create pull request. In java this will be done using SpringAI.

Before I arrived at the Magnetizing FloorPlanGenerator, I tested various computational methods for floor plan generation. Each approach revealed strengths, weaknesses, and insights that ultimately shaped the final tool.

The Approaches I Tried
1. Constraint-Based Systems
Idea: Define strict rules for room dimensions, adjacencies, and boundaries.
Result: Reliable but too rigid for the complex layouts of public buildings.

2. Agent-Based Systems
Idea: Treat rooms as agents that interact based on predefined rules.
Result: Creative but often inefficient and poorly optimized for larger layouts.

3. Tensor Fields
Idea: Use vector fields to guide room placements.
Result: Visually intuitive but struggled to maintain adjacencies.

4. Spring Systems
Idea: Model rooms as physical objects connected by "springs" to balance forces.
Result: Great for compact layouts but computationally intensive.

5. Evolutionary Algorithms
Idea: Iteratively refine solutions using natural selection principles.
Result: Promising but slow and required more structured logic.

What Worked‚Äîand What Didn‚Äôt
These methods offered valuable insights but fell short of solving key challenges like maintaining logical adjacencies, optimizing space, and scaling to complex layouts. I realized a hybrid approach was needed‚Äîone that combined flexibility, logic, and computational efficiency.

How I Found the Solution
The breakthrough came from focusing on a clear logical backbone: the evacuation plan. By treating corridors as the "spine" of the layout, I could:
1. Ensure every room connected seamlessly.
2. Use iterative refinement to build functional layouts.
3. Combine the adaptability of evolutionary strategies with the structure of adjacency logic.

Looking Ahead
In the next post, I‚Äôll explain how the evacuation plan became the foundation of the Magnetizing FloorPlanGenerator and why it works so effectively.
What computational approaches have you explored? Did any surprise you, either positively or negatively? Let‚Äôs discuss!

Last month, I opened an old script of mine that I hadn't touched for a long time. I thought 'No problem - it's my own code, it won't take long '. But I was wrong...

You see, when I'm testing an idea, I write code quick and dirty. And then I go back and clean it up once I know it works. But I hadn't refactored this one yet, and it felt like solving a Rubik's cube in the dark.

Sound Familiar?

Now, imagine trying to read someone else‚Äôs code written in the same rushed, chaotic style. What do you do?

Luckily we have AI. Now we can get faster and better answers without judgement about asking stupid questions (I'm also guilty of the last one).

But here is the catch: AI is only as good as your prompt.

So it's a good idea spending some time on creating better prompts to get much better results.

Or you can use this prompt I made for beginners in my course to help them reverse engineer somebody's code.

--------------------------------------------------
üìú CHAT GPT PROMPT:

I want you to act as a seasoned Python software engineer with extensive expertise in Revit API and pyRevit. I will provide a piece of existing pyRevit code, and I need you to:
- Provide a short and clear code overview outlining all the steps.
- Write a step-by-step tutorial tailored for a beginner pyRevit user, explaining each section of the code in simple terms.
- Describe all Revit API concepts used in the code, offering beginner-friendly examples where necessary.

Here is the code:
{PASTE CODE HERE}
--------------------------------------------------

üëÜ This prompt works magic because:
- It explains the code in plain English without BS.
- It generates a tutorial for beginners based on the code.
- It identifies Revit API concepts you need to know and often explains them clearly for beginners.

The secret is to ask it to make a tutorial. It starts to think differently about the output. This approach is like having a teacher walk you through the code step by step.

But sometimes you still need to ask that teacher twice üëÄ.

------------------------------
P.S.

Great one man!

I can relate. I wrote a 300-line script today that works perfectly, but I know I'll have to clean it up at some point‚Äîand I might be too scared to touch it!

On the point of refactoring üëá

ChatGPT is great for refactoring straightforward scripts, but to build on your point Erik, adding inline comments in your code to explain the logic, assumptions, and exceptions can really help.

It reduces misunderstandings and transformer hallucinations and prevents breaking code that's already working perfectly.

It's best to clean up while your mind is still fresh if you have some spare time. After a while you need to spend time to remember what's going on and it's the least fun part of it.

One tip: Don't try to make it the best code you ever wrote. We will always find ways to make it better on every single rewrite. We need to find that balance
