  There's a saying about assuming... I'll leave it up to you to find on the internet.
  For others scraping through these posts looking for a modicum of actual help, here's how I ended up solving it with help from @Mohamed_Arshad (who actually provided some guidance).
  using (Transaction trans = new Transaction(doc, "Tag Parent Doors"))
  {
      trans.Start();

      foreach (FamilyInstance door in doors)
      {
          if (new FilteredElementCollector(doc, currentView.Id)
               .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_DoorTags)
               .OfClass(typeof(IndependentTag))
               .Cast<IndependentTag>()
               .SelectMany(x => x.GetTaggedLocalElementIds())
               .Where(x => x == door.Id).Any())
          {
              skipCount++;
              continue;
          }
      }

<h4><a name="2"></a> Revit API Support with Gemini LLM</h4>
<p>I continue using LLMs to answer the odd query in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> with
great success.</p>
<p>I check the question and evaluate whether I can answer it myself or not.

In some cases, I decide to ask the LLM for help.

<p>I cannot always verify that the answer provided is completely accurate.
Repeating the question will yield a different answer every time.
So, a customer seeking perfection would be well advised to submit it several times over and pick the best one, or the best bits from several.</p>
<p>I often do check that the API calls in the sample code exist.
In one of the cases listed above, Gemini produced sample code that hallucinated non-existent Revit API calls.
I noticed that and replied to the LLM, saying: “hey, the call you list in your sample code does not exist”.
Thereupon the LLM answered, “you are absolutely correct. Sorry about that. Here is true valid sample code instead”.
The second answer included true API calls, and I provided that to the customer.</p>
<p>So, important aspect to note: every answer will be different, and some answers contain hallucinations, so every interaction must be taken with a pinch of salt and not blindly trusting.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> UIApplication Access</h4>
<p>Luiz Henrique <a href="https://ricaun.com/">@ricaun</a> Cassettari
shared a new approach to access the <code>UIApplication</code> object in the thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-to-get-uiapplication-from-iexternalapplication/td-p/6355729">how to get UIApplication from IExternalApplication</a>:</p>
<p>Actually you can access the internal UIApplication directly inside the UIControlledApplication using Reflection with no need for any events:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs">public Result OnStartup(UIControlledApplication application)
{
    UIApplication uiapp = application.GetUIApplication();
    string userName = uiapp.Application.Username;
    return Result.Succeeded;
}</code></pre>

<p>Here is the extension code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Get &lt;see cref="Autodesk.Revit.UI.UIApplication"/&gt; using the &lt;paramref name="application"/&gt;
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="application"&gt;Revit UIApplication&lt;/param&gt;
public static UIApplication GetUIApplication(this UIControlledApplication application)
{
    var type = typeof(UIControlledApplication);

    var propertie = type.GetFields(BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic)
        .FirstOrDefault(e =&gt; e.FieldType == typeof(UIApplication));

    return propertie?.GetValue(application) as UIApplication;
}</code></pre>

<p>The whole implementation including the extension to convert UIApplication to UIControlledApplication is shared in
the <a href="https://github.com/ricaun-io/ricaun.Revit.DI/tree/master">ricaun.Revit.DI</a> dependency injection container extension and
in the module <a href="https://github.com/ricaun-io/ricaun.Revit.DI/blob/master/ricaun.Revit.DI/Extensions/UIControlledApplicationExtension.cs">UIControlledApplicationExtension.cs</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="5"></a> Self-Operating Computer Framework</h4>
<p>I haven't tried anything like this myself yet, but it is interesting to note

<h4><a name="6"></a> BigBlueButton  and Conferencing Tools</h4>
<p>I <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2024/05/migrating-vb-to-net-core-8-and-ai-news.html#4">recently mentioned</a> a
couple of video conferencing options; let's expand that list:</p>
<p><a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/#">BigBlueButton</a> also includes functionality for <a href="https://bbb.m4h.network/b/">conferencing</a>:</p>

<p>An article about leadership and personal behaviour brought to my attention

Originally formulated for software protocols and software design in general, it is actually applicable to almost every aspect of everyday life and human interaction:</p>

<h4><a name="9"></a> Stargate Cost Comparison</h4>
<p>I wondered how the US $500B Stargate AI project cost compares to other huge projects.
Here is a comparison of costs gleaned from
a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i6zid8/just_a_comparison_of_us_500b_stargate_ai_project/">reddit post</a>,
with the Marshall Plan added by me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marshall Plan ~$150 billion in today’s dollars, $13.3 billion at the time (~5.2% of US GDP)</li>
<li>Manhattan Project ~$30 billion in today’s dollars [~1.5% of US GDP in the mid-1940s]</li>
<li>Apollo Program ~$170–$180 billion in today’s dollars [~0.5% of US GDP in the mid-1960s]</li>
<li>Space Shuttle Program ~$275–$300 billion in today’s dollars [~0.2% of US GDP in the early 1980s]</li>
<li>Interstate Highway System, entire decades-long Interstate Highway System buildout, ~$500–$550 billion in today’s dollars [~0.2%–0.3% of GDP annually over multiple decades]</li>
<li>Stargate is huge AI project [~1.7% of US GDP 2024]</li>
