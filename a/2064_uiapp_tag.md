  There's a saying about assuming... I'll leave it up to you to find on the internet.
  For others scraping through these posts looking for a modicum of actual help, here's how I ended up solving it with help from @Mohamed_Arshad (who actually provided some guidance).
  using (Transaction trans = new Transaction(doc, "Tag Parent Doors"))
  {
      trans.Start();

      foreach (FamilyInstance door in doors)
      {
          if (new FilteredElementCollector(doc, currentView.Id)
               .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_DoorTags)
               .OfClass(typeof(IndependentTag))
               .Cast<IndependentTag>()
               .SelectMany(x => x.GetTaggedLocalElementIds())
               .Where(x => x == door.Id).Any())
          {
              skipCount++;
              continue;
          }
      }
  }
