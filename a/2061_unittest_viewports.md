- Chinese curse: [May you live in interesting times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times)
  To tell the truth, there is no known Chinese equivalent; the closest is Better to be a dog in times of tranquility than a human in times of chaos": 寧為太平犬，不做亂世人
  Surveying an apparently collapsing China, Mao Zedong coolly observed that there was “great disorder under the Heavens and the situation is excellent.”
  --
  die Englaender nennen es den Chinesischen Fluch: May you live in interesting times. In Wahrheit ist so ein Spruch in China anscheinend nicht bekannt; das naheliegendste lautet ungefaehr: "Lieber ein Hund in ruhigen Zeiten sein als ein Mensch in chaotischen -- 寧為太平犬，不做亂世人". Mao Zedong hat ganz cool hinzugefuegt: “es herrrscht grosse Unordnung unter dem Himmel; die Lage ist vorzueglich.” Ich wuensche uns allen auch alles vorzuegliche.

  Abstract: In this paper we describe a five-stage phenomenological model of skill acquisition, of which expertise is the highest stage. Contrary to the claims of knowledge engineers, we argue that expertise in general, and medical expertise in particular, cannot be captured in rule-based expert systems, since expertise is based on the making of immediate, unreflective situational responses; intuitive judgment is the hallmark of expertise. Deliberation is certainly used by experts, if time permits, but it is done for the purpose of improving intuition, not replacing it. The best way to avoid mistakes is to take responsibility for them when they occur, rather than try to prevent them by foolproof rules. In bureaucratic societies, however, there is the danger that expertise may be diminished through over-reliance on calculative rationality.

### Back Again to Unit Test, Icons, Viewports and More


####<a name="2"></a> Happy New Year!

Happy New Year to all the brilliant minds in the Revit API developer community!
Wishing you a year filled with joy, success in all your endeavors, and may your coding adventures be fruitful and rewarding.
Peace and happiness to all.

Unfortunately, in the past few months, I keep being reminded of the so-called Chinese curse:
[May you live in interesting times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times).
In fact, it appears that there is no known Chinese equivalent; the closest is "Better to be a dog in times of tranquility than a human in times of chaos", 寧為太平犬，不做亂世人.
Taking a completely opposite view, surveying an apparently collapsing China, Mao Zedong coolly observed that there was “great disorder under the Heavens and the situation is excellent.”
Interesting times indeed.

####<a name="3"></a> Back Again and Winding Up

As I mentioned in November,
[my retirement is nearing](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2024/11/devcon-ai-for-revit-api-modeless-add-ins-leave.html#3)
and I took time off in the past two months.

I am back again now and thinking about how to wind up my activities before retiring towords the middle of the year.

Meanwhile, it is facinating to follow the advancements in AI and LLMs.
I am confident that already today, most of the repetitive questions that keep coming up in the Revit API forum can be answered by proper queries to one of the LLMs.

Today, I would like to highlight three new non-repetitive threads from the past week here, and also list a few of the AI-related titbits that caught my attention.
